I really got bored with the common locks like that L pattern or G pattern etc. I Wanted something truelly random beyond human's predictablity.

More than anything It was a learning experience to code to algoritms to gnerate the passowords and figuring out the coordinates of each pattern point and drawing the pattern on the canvas.
Note: The patterns have a random length but you can hard code it to be of a certain length of between a range of lengths.
